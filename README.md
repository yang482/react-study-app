## 초기 설정
React 사이트의 자습서에서 제공되는 내용으로 초기 설정

## 사용 가능한 스크립트

### `npm start`

개발 모드로 앱을 실행한다.\
이후 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)를 브라우저로 열어준다.

### `npm test`

대화형 감시 모드 (interactive watch mode) 에서 테스트를 실행한다.

더 많은 정보를 원하면 다음 사이트 참조 [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### `npm run build`

운영을 위한 앱을 `build` 폴더에 빌드한다.\
이 명령어는 운영 모드에서 React를 올바르게 번들로 묶는다.\
그리고 최고의 성능을 위해 빌드를 최적화 한다. 

빌드는 최소화 되고 파일 이름에 hash가 포함된다.\
당신의 앱이 배포될 준비가 되었다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
